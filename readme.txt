Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game is played on a 3x3 board, and the players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on the board until one of them wins or the game ends in a tie.

Usage
To compile the program, run the following command:

Copy code
g++ -o tictactoe tictactoe.cpp
To run the program, enter the following command:

bash
Copy code
./tictactoe
Once the program is running, the game will start. The board will be displayed, and the first player (X) will be asked to make a move. To make a move, the player needs to enter a number from 1 to 9, which corresponds to a cell on the board, as shown below:

markdown
Copy code
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
If the input is invalid or the chosen cell is already occupied, the player will be asked to enter a valid move again.

The game ends when one of the players gets three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are occupied without either player winning.

Functionality
The program has the following functions:

void drawBoard(char board[][3])
This function draws the current state of the game board to the console.

bool check_move(char board[][3], int row, int col)
This function checks if the chosen move is valid (i.e., the cell is unoccupied and within the boundaries of the board).

void getPlayerChoice()
This function asks the current player to make a move and updates the game board if the move is valid.

bool isGameOver()
This function checks if the game is over (i.e., one of the players has won or the game is a tie).

void switch_player(char& current_player)
This function switches the current player after each move.

bool make_move(char board[][3], char player, int row, int col)
This function makes a move on the game board for the specified player.

bool check_win(char board[][3], char player)
This function checks if the specified player has won the game.

Limitations
This implementation of Tic Tac Toe has the following limitations:

The program does not have an AI opponent; it can only be played by two human players.
The program does not have a graphical user interface (GUI); the game board is displayed on the console.
The program does not have a score tracker; it only shows the state of the game board.
